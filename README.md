## Getting Started

### 1. Check out `CONTRIBUTING.md` <!-- omit from toc -->

Read through our [contributing document](./CONTRIBUTING.md) to get up-to-speed with project standards and expectations.

### 2. Create a `Firebase` iOS application <!-- omit from toc -->

Our application runs mostly through Google's [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) platform.

You can go [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup) to get started setting up an iOS application.

### 3. Create a `Spotify` API application <!-- omit from toc -->

Head over to your [Spotify Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/) and register a new application.

**App name:** `YouPlay`

**App description:** `A mood based music streaming service.`

**Website:** _Can be left empty_

**Redirect URI:** `spotify-ios-you-play://spotify-login-callback`

**Which API/SDKs are you planning to use?**

- [x] `Web API`
- [x] `iOS`

After you have done the initial setup, open the app's `Settings` and add the following **iOS app bundles**:

- `com.you-play.YouPlay`

Your settings should be similar to [this.](./assets//docs/spotify_app_dashboard.png)

Lastly, make sure the [App bundle](./assets/docs/bundle_id.png) within `XCode` matches above.

**Note:** If the bundle ID is NOT available in `XCode`, you can add a suffix (ex. `com.you-play.YouPlay-Sebastian`). Make sure to update it in your [Spotify Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/) settings.

### 4. Run the App Locally <!-- omit from toc -->

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/you-play/YouPlay/`
2. Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` (not required if you have your own Firebase app) and `SpotifyService.plist` from our [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1mpas-2XIVRFXT4UJKt6yppe0XE1tgUjC) (or you can find empty "templates" [here](./assets/docs/templates/))
3. Replace/add the `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` in the `SpotifyService.plist` with your own Spotify credentials
4. Add the `GoogleService-Info.plist` and `SpotifyService.plist` into `/ios-app/YouPlay/` folder (**Tip:** you can drop the files directly into the `XCode` UI file explorer)
5. Build and start the app in `Xcode`
